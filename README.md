### Todo App

Just your run-of-the-mill CRUD todo app. Currently only has backend functionality.

-------------

Future plans:
- Add a User model
- Adjust functionality to restrict Todos to the user that created them
- Create sign up/log in routes
- Restrict the main route (viewing todos) to logged in users
- Completely refactor backend logic
  - Move DB operations into a class responsible for all CRUD to improve on expandability
  - Create Util libraries for some common operations
- Create a React or Vue frontend so the app is actually useable
- Convert to an Electron app so I can use this project as an actual tool
